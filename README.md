![Zero Trust CPS Architecture](docs/cps-zero-trust-architecture.png)

## Overview
Enterprise-ready Zero Trust implementation framework for protecting critical cyber-physical systems (ICS, IoT, medical devices) with integrated threat intelligence.

## Features
- Automated CPS asset discovery and classification
- Dynamic policy engine for micro-segmentation
- Real-time threat intelligence integration
- Incident response simulation scenarios
- Compliance dashboards (NIST CSF 2.0, IEC 62443)

## Getting Started
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   export CPS_NETWORK=10.0.0.0/24
   export ZTA_POLICY_ENGINE=azure_adtion
